Hannibal is a turn-based strategy game in which players can play against each other over the web. Users can create 1vs1 public or private games without registration. However, it is possible to register to keep records of the games played and compete with other users to be at the top of the leaderboard.

## Getting started
<p>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
</p>

### Prerequisites and Installation
Get the [Hannibal server](https://github.com/sopra-fs22-group-16/sopra-fs22-group-16-server) and [Hannibal client](https://github.com/sopra-fs22-group-16/sopra-fs22-group-16-client) repository from GitHub and follow the installation guide in each repository.

For your local development environment, you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). All other dependencies, including React, get installed with:

```bash
npm install
```

Run this command before you start your application for the first time. Next, you can start the app with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Now you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Build
This command builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
```bash
npm run build
```
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance: the build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.<br>

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Testing
There are currently no tests on the client version of Hannibal.

Tests can be run with the command:
```bash
npm run test
```

This launches the test runner in an interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.


### Deployment
After each commit to the master branch, automatic Github Actions get executed which deploy our application to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

# SoPra RESTful Service Template FS22

## Getting started with Spring Boot

-   Documentation: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/index.html
-   Guides: http://spring.io/guides
    -   Building a RESTful Web Service: http://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/
    -   Building REST services with Spring: http://spring.io/guides/tutorials/bookmarks/

## Setup this Template with your IDE of choice

Download your IDE of choice: (e.g., [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/), [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and make sure Java 15 is installed on your system (for Windows-users, please make sure your JAVA_HOME environment variable is set to the correct version of Java).

1. File -> Open... -> SoPra Server Template
2. Accept to import the project as a `gradle project`

To build right click the `build.gradle` file and choose `Run Build`

### VS Code
The following extensions will help you to run it more easily:
-   `pivotal.vscode-spring-boot`
-   `vscjava.vscode-spring-initializr`
-   `vscjava.vscode-spring-boot-dashboard`
-   `vscjava.vscode-java-pack`
-   `richardwillis.vscode-gradle`

**Note:** You'll need to build the project first with Gradle, just click on the `build` command in the _Gradle Tasks_ extension. Then check the _Spring Boot Dashboard_ extension if it already shows `soprafs22` and hit the play button to start the server. If it doesn't show up, restart VS Code and check again.

## Building with Gradle

You can use the local Gradle Wrapper to build the application.
-   macOS: `./gradlew`
-   Linux: `./gradlew`
-   Windows: `./gradlew.bat`

More Information about [Gradle Wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/docs/).

### Build

```bash
./gradlew build
```

### Run

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

### Test

```bash
./gradlew test
```

### Development Mode

You can start the backend in development mode, this will automatically trigger a new build and reload the application
once the content of a file has been changed and you save the file.

Start two terminal windows and run:

`./gradlew build --continuous`

and in the other one:

`./gradlew bootRun`

If you want to avoid running all tests with every change, use the following command instead:

`./gradlew build --continuous -xtest`

## API Endpoint Testing

### Postman

-   We highly recommend to use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com) in order to test your API Endpoints.

## Debugging

If something is not working and/or you don't know what is going on. We highly recommend that you use a debugger and step
through the process step-by-step.

To configure a debugger for SpringBoot's Tomcat servlet (i.e. the process you start with `./gradlew bootRun` command),
do the following:

1. Open Tab: **Run**/Edit Configurations
2. Add a new Remote Configuration and name it properly
3. Start the Server in Debug mode: `./gradlew bootRun --debug-jvm`
4. Press `Shift + F9` or the use **Run**/Debug"Name of your task"
5. Set breakpoints in the application where you need it
6. Step through the process one step at a time
